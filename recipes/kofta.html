    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Kofta is a popular dish made from grilled ground beef that is served
      throughout the Middle-East. This is a wonderful and simple version I
      picked up in Egypt. A great accompaniment is saffron rice.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg yolk,
        oregano, salt and pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pick up medium sized handfuls and press them onto skewers. Roll on a
        lightly oiled clean surface until the mixture looks like a large ground
        beef hot dog with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place
        your fingers in the middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into
        two sausages with about 1 inch of skewer sticking out at each end.
      </li>

      <li>
        Prepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like
        myself, heat it over medium-high heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10
        minutes, turning once or twice for even cooking. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
