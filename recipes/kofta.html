    <h3>Description</h3>
    Kofta is a popular dish made from grilled ground beef that is served throughout the Middle-East. This is a wonderful
    and simple version I picked up in Egypt. A great accompaniment is saffron rice.</p>


    <p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg yolk, oregano, salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Pick up medium sized handfuls and press them onto skewers. Roll on a lightly oiled clean surface until the
            mixture looks like a large ground beef hot dog with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place your
            fingers in the middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into two sausages with about 1 inch of skewer
            sticking out at each end.</li>

        <li>Prepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like myself, heat it over medium-high heat.
        </li>

        <li>Place the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice for even
            cooking. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
